# APSAT
APSAT is a puzzle game based on finding solutions to boolean expressions. You're given a simple expression, like
```(A OR NOT B) AND (C)```
And you must either calculate a solution, or claim that there is none. You're given a set of coins at the start. You earn coins for correct answers, and lose coins for incorrect answers. You can spend coins on things like hints, where an SAT solver gives you a partial solution, or you could skip a question by fulling utilizing an SAT solver.

You may choose to gamble your coins on difficult problems, or safekeep them. 

This game is meant to introduce players to logical reasoning and boolean expressions. I also encourage the use of techniques like De Morgan's laws. In the end, however, this is a front for something much larger-- an SAT Solver. Boolean satisfiability is a very large field in computer science, and I thought that it would be an interesting idea for a puzzle game, as well as an opportunity to show what I've learned.

There's a philosophical side to this as well. The coins are your agency, what you can and cannot do. They represent your intricate balance as you try to stay afloat. The goal is to keep your coins, your agency, for as long as you can. This game is a demonstration of a computer's sheer computational power, and what you can accomplish with it.
