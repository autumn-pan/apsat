# APSAT
APSAT was planned to be a puzzle game based around B-SAT, but I unfortunately ran out of time and had to scrap the game. Below, You'll find the SAT solver I made for it. gen_formula() generates a formula in cnf form, which can be solved using solve(). Deploying this is as simple as
```git clone https://github.com/autumn-pan/apsat```

In the commit history, I believe you may view what I was planning. Unfortunately, I couldn't follow the theme, but I certainly will next time.
